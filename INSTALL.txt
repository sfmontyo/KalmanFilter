Building
Run cmake to create the cmake build subdirectory. In the cmake build
directory,

make all
sudo make install

A small static library (libkalman.a) will be installed in /usr/local/lib. A 
directory named 'kalman' containing all necessary include files will be 
installed in /usr/local/include. If you wish to install elsewhere, please 
modify the top variables in 'makefile'.

Running the examples
After building the examples using make all from with the cmake build folder
go to the subdirectory
cd ${ROOT}/examples/src
../../${CMAKE_BUILD_DIRECTORY}/examples/kalmanExamples

This will run the examples.
