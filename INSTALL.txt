MacOS X installation
For mac, you need the following
brew install cmake
brew install doxygen
brew install graphviz # for dot
brew cask install mactext # for the latex output in the doc
brew cask install texmaker

UNIX/Linux case :
sudo apt-get install cmake doxygen graphviz

Building
Run cmake to create the cmake build subdirectory. In the cmake build
directory,

make all
sudo make install

A small static library (libkalman.a) will be installed in /usr/local/lib. A 
directory named 'kalman' containing all necessary include files will be 
installed in /usr/local/include. If you wish to install elsewhere, please 
modify the top variables in 'makefile'.
